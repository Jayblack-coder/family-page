            Nmelonye, originally from Nise, migrated to Arondizuogu due to a
            family dispute. There, he found a new home, married, and built a
            lineage that continues to grow in unity and strength. His story is a
            testament to resilience, adaptability, and the enduring spirit of
            family.
